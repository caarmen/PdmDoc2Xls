This project is probably of little use to anybody.
It's just a backup of some scripts that I'm using:
* to learn groovy
* to extract some content from some text documents
  I have and export the content to Excel.

To run on the command line:

./gradlew run -PappArgs="['/path/to/input/textfile.txt',  '/path/to/output/excelfile.xls']"
